Abstract
====
In real-life people live together in the same place, recognize theiractivities is challenging than activities of one single resident, but essential tocollect information about real life activities inside home, then ease the assistedliving in the real environment. This paper presents a multilayer perceptron modeland a supervised learning technique called backpropagation to train a neuralnetwork in order to recognize multi-users activities inside smart home, and selectuseful features according to minimum redundancy maximum relevance. Theresults show that different feature datasets and different number of neurons ofhidden layer of neural network yield different activity recognition accuracy. Theselection of suitable feature datasets increases the activity recognition accuracyand reduces the time of execution. Our experimental results show that we achievean accuracy of 99% with the winner method and 96% with the threshold method,respectively, for recognizing multi-user activities.
