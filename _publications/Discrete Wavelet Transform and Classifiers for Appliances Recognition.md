# Abstract

Recognition of appliancesâ€™ signatures is an important task in energydisaggregation  applications.  To  save  and  manage  energy,  load  signaturesprovided  by  appliances  can  be  used  to  detect  which  appliance  is  used.  In  thisstudy, we use a low frequency database to identify appliances based on discretewavelet  transform  for  features  extraction  and  data  dimensionality  reduction.Further that, the accuracy of several classifiers is investigated. This paper aimsto prove the effectiveness of DWT in load signatures recognition. Then, the bestclassifier for this studied task is selected.
