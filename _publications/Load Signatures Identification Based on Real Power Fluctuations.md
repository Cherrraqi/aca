Abstract
=======
Identification of individual sources of energy consumption is one newresearch  area  that  contributes  to  reduce  electricity  consumption  in  buildings,generate energy awareness and improve efficiency of available energy resourcesusage.  This  paper  proposes  a  solution  based  on  Multilayer  Perceptron  and  thechange  of  real  power  to  distinguish  and  identify  appliances  from  the  raw  loadsignatures directly without features extraction. Our simulation indicates that theseraw load signatures can offer a quick and accurate identification.
